        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a
        member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark
        vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an
        apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild
        boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator,
        requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its
        requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with
        their mother for about two years, before they become independent and
        leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
