        Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that
        inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is
        divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas
        (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies. They
        are the largest living primates. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar
        to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and
        they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the
        chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or
        subtropical forests in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a
        small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations.
        The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests
        of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres
        (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland
        swamps and marshes as low as sea level. Gorillas are herbivorous, with a
        heavily frugivorous diet, but they also eat leaves, stems, and shoots.
        Although gorillas are similar to humans, they are not found in the same
        areas as humans. Gorillas are known to be intelligent animals. They have
        been shown to use tools in the wild. A report of a gorilla using a stick
        to gauge the depth of water while crossing a swamp was considered to be
        the first suggestion of tool use in a non-human animal.
