        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to South
        Central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black
        patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The
        name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red
        panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order
        Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in
        the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat
        in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may
        receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along
        with specially prepared food. The giant panda lives in a few mountain
        ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighboring
        Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other
        development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas
        where it once lived. The giant panda is a conservation-reliant
        vulnerable species.
